    {{user}} hello there!
    <br>
    We used a post request to get your username!
    <br>
    From the homework assignment, what we deduced is that GET and POST are different ways to transfer information from the frontend to backend.<br>
    What we noticed is that GET had all of the form inputs in the url but POST did not have the form responses in the url<br>
    Perhaps this means that POST is more secure

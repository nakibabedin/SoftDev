Disco:
    -We need to inclue method="POST" to the form tag to use post methods
    -Can't use request.args when we assign a post method to a form tag
    -request.forms is equivalent to request.args for the post method
    -request.forms.get() could be used to get the element inside request.forms
    
QCC:
    -We don't completely understand the difference between POST and GET
    -We think that both POST and GET gets information from the input, but not the specifics of each

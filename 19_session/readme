K19 -- working w/ sessions
2022-11-04
time spent: .7

DISCO:
- we can use if 'username' in session: to see if the username is logged in or not
- sessions do not work without a secret key
- sessions work when closing the tab and reloading it again but not after the server stops running

QCC:
- do we have to use if 'username' in session for each route of our app if we want logged in sessions or is there an easier way?

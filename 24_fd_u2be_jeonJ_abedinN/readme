k24 -- testing foundation
2022-11-30
Time Spent: 0.5 hrs

q0: 1
q0b: The information from the en ramp was sufficient enough to create our website, but we went to https://get.foundation to explore more about foundation and what it is

q1: Contrary to what we were hearing from our classmates, we actually preferred to use foundation. We thought the default in-built features (e.g. navbar, dropdown menus) helped us improve productivty.

DISCO:
1) Foundation has an inbuilt feature for a nav bar, dropdown menu, and much more

QCC:
1) Is there a way to change the default size of the foundation cards without changing the CSS?

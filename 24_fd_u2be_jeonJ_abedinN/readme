q0: 0
q1: Contrary to what we were hearing from our classmates, we actually preferred to use foundation. We thought the default in-built features (e.g. navbar, dropdown menus) helped us improve productivty.

DISCO:
1) Foundation has an inbuilt feature for a nav bar, dropdown menu, and much more

QCC:
1) Is there a way to change the default size of the foundation cards without changing the CSS?

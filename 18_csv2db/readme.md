DISCO:
- fstrings can help add data into the table without concatenation
- drop table helps solve the issue with the table already existing
- learned how to use sqlite3 in python file
- we can use fetchall() to print the tables in python
- we can use open() with DictReader to go through a csv file

QCC:
- what exactly does fetchall() do to allow us to print it?

K23 -- A Day of Noodling (testing bootstrap)
2022-11-29
Time Taken: 1.0 hrs

DISCO:
	On this MacBook, font family defaults to: 
		system-ui,-apple-system,"Segoe UI",Roboto,"Helvetica Neue","Noto Sans","Liberation Sans",Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol","Noto Color Emoji"
	as opposed to the usual serif font

	h1 text and all columns/containers scales with window size

	Columns: Placing text on certain parts of the screen are way easier now
	12 columns in total
	A column of size x would take up the space of x regular columns

	You can add onto the default styling from Bootstrap using your own CSS

QCC:
	Is the default font family different across different operating systems?
	How do we change the CSS for an entire class at once (e.g. instead of having to do styling for col-1 col-2 col-3 ..., is there a way to edit the CSS for all col classes at the same time?)
